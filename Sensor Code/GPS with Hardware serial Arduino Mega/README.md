Data you get from gps is encoded. Use tinygps or tinygps+ library to decode it. GPS gives you Time, Speed, Latitud, Longitud, Altitud, Number of Satelites it's connected to, Location of those satellites, names of those satellites, compass as well (not so accurate, use magnetometer instead). Not sure if they're all included in the libraries I mentioned, I was using u-centre on my laptop to debug GPS data. Used. USB-serial cable to do that.
